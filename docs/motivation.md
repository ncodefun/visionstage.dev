### Leaving dark magic behind

If traditional frameworks can make you program in smarter, more advanced ways, they also rely on dark magic; your app is made of non-standard pieces that get transformed and assembled magically, and it's not obvious how or in what order. Sometimes it's very hard to figure out how to do very simple things, because you have zero visibility of the complete picture and of the global logic flow - without looking under the hood, trying to see how tens or hundreds of pieces all work together... (docs, proper, updated docs may be helpful, if you find it, and it covers your specific need) In other words, eventually, you often end up hitting a wall and realize that in order to make simple things you want, you need to become an expert of the mega framework/library you're using...
Or keep trying to find answers or help.

That is far from ideal for focused / creative, high-level developers that would rather stay in the flow... This constant hitting the wall of artificial (inherent) limits you need to master or work around, is pure, incessant frustration, loss of focus, of productivity, and a killer of creativity. And think about students learning to code; it's hard enough learning how to make your actual app without having to learn deeply complex frameworks and tooling systems developed by advanced programmersâ€¦ Poor guys!
