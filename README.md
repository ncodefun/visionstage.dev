# Vision Stage

## The simple, intuitive way to make Web apps
### *‚ú¶ Zero friction ‚á¢ Pure focus‚Ää! ‚ú¶*

This is what happens when someone builds a framework, looking only for elegance and simplicity; you create a superb developer experience. Yes, you won't have some goodies that modern tooling can provide, but on the plus side hand, you don't have any tooling to deal with‚Ä¶ Nor do you have to deal with an overly complex framework, with so many barriers and nerdy concepts you *must* learn and use, for your own good my child‚Ä¶ God forbid you should shoot yourself in the foot! Like everyone is building a freaky monster app √† la Facebook‚Ää! Here you have a simple base from which you can do what you want, without any artificial limits.

Spare yourself a sea of endless confusion and frustrations, keep it simple, **focused**, and see how far you can go when you care more about freedom and lightness than about conformity and tightness.

We may say that Vision Stage is for quickly and easily prototyping a Web app, but you'll wonder why on earth you should then redo your app in way more time, and way less fun - for minimal gains, and probably for reassuring fearful, worrying minds that demand conformity. ü§∑ You have to be at least a bit adventurous to use Vision Stage; yet it's not like it's a huge investment of time to give it a try. Plus, with such a simple, "vanilla" framework, if you find yourself limited in any way, you can easily add to it or modify it without having to study all the intricacies of a monster library/framework‚Ä¶ I'd call that *truly* agile and future-proof development.

Lots of things could be optimized, but the only goal until now was to build the most intuitive workflow / API possible. Not every use case has been taken into account, but I've made quite a lot of educational apps using it, which allowed me to catch a lot of issues, so in the end it's pretty well rounded frameword for relatively simple small / medium apps.

Vision Stage is a work of art; this is the word of an artist, the fruit of years of decisions and redoing, always looking ahead for the clearest path. I hope you find the same joy using it as the joy I had and still have developing it.

*Currently, I'm in the process of documenting Vision Stage properly, making examples and (forever) cleaning and refining styles.*

Have something to say boot that little gravity-defying project? Get in touch‚Ää! I really hope to find nice people to collaborate with, even ‚Äì yes ‚Äì you damn overthinking engineers‚Ä¶ üòã I'm passionate about making of systems ‚Äì it's the reason I made this little framework ‚Äì I just think they often are more of a hindrance than a help to us, regular Joe developers out there, but I have hope‚Ää! I really beleive the future is bright‚Ää, and uncomplicated!

My name is Josef, I live in Montr√©al and speak French. And apparently, I kinda lost my mind‚Ä¶

Peace. ‚úåÔ∏è
