# Vision Stage

## The simple, intuitive way to make Web apps
### *‚ú¶ Zero friction ‚á¢ Pure focus‚Ää! ‚ú¶*

**Vision Stage is a work of Love.**

This is what happens when someone builds a framework, looking only for elegance and simplicity; you create a superb developer experience. Yes, you won't have some goodies that modern tooling can provide, but on the plus side hand, you don't have any tooling to deal with‚Ä¶ Nor do you have to deal with an overly complex framework, with so many barriers and nerdy concepts you *must* learn and use, for your own good my child‚Ä¶ God forbid you should shoot yourself in the foot! Like everyone is building a freaky monster app √† la Facebook‚Ää! Here you have a simple base from which you can do what you want, without any artificial limits.

Spare yourself a sea of endless confusion and frustrations, keep it simple, **focused**, and see how far you can go when you care more about freedom and lightness than about conformity and tightness.

We may say that Vision Stage is for quickly and easily prototyping a Web app, but you'll wonder why on earth you should then redo your app in way more time, and way less fun - for minimal gains, and probably for reassuring fearful, worrying minds which demand conformity. ü§∑

Obviously, this is not for everyone, especially not if you have a boss‚Ää! You have to be at least a bit adventurous to use such an "experimental" framework; yet it's not like it's a huge investment of time to give it a try. Plus, with such a simple framework, if you find yourself limited, you can easily add to it or modify it without a PHD in nuclear physic‚Ä¶ Anyway, I bet there's enough free minds around making personal projects to try it out, so I guess it's worth sharing at last‚Ää!

Clearly, Vision Stage is a work of art, and not an engineer's toy. This is the word of an artist, the fruit of years of decisions and redoing, always looking ahead for the clearest path. I hope you find the same joy using it as the joy I had and still have developing it.

*Currently, I'm in the process of documenting Vision Stage properly, making examples and (forever) cleaning and refining styles.*


Having something to say boot that little gravity-defying project? Get in touch‚Ää! I really hope to find nice people to collaborate with, even ‚Äì yes ‚Äì you damn overthinking engineers‚Ä¶ üòã I do respect smart people, and love the making of systems ‚Äì it's the reason I made this little framework ‚Äì I just think they often are more of a hindrance than of help to us, regular Joe developers out there, but I have hope‚Ää! See, I'm of those who beleive the future is bright. üòé

My name is Josef, I live in Montr√©al and speak French. And apparently, I kinda lost my mind‚Ä¶ ü§Ø

Peace. ‚úåÔ∏è
