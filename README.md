# Vision Stage

## The simple, intuitive way to make Web apps
### *✦ Zero friction ⇢ Pure focus ! ✦*

[→ Français](./README-fr.md)

Vision stage is a minimalist & intuitive Web component library and Web app framework, using lit-html templates and reactive properties – all with vanilla JS/HTML. No build step required.

## KISS ❤

Vision Stage provides – I beleive – the best developer experience out there… Its simplicity frees you from wasteful diversions with the concerns, confusion and frustrations of working with non-standard syntax, concepts and workflow / tooling that other, complex libraries and frameworks force you to deal with.

Such true simplicity means you can **stay in the creative flow**, and **focus on what matter – *your* app !** In my book, *that* is truly agile, and future-proof development…


Forget about ultra-optimizing everything; simplicity is already, by nature, lightweight and fast. Quite fast enough in fact, compared to so many small and medium apps using way overkill frameworks…

I hope you find the same joy using it as the joy I had and still have developing it ! ✌

*Currently, I'm in the process of documenting Vision Stage properly, making examples and (forever) cleaning and refining styles.*
